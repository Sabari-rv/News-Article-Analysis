This is why many people were injured and killed,\" he added.NDRF Commandant VVN Prasanna Kumar said they are using advanced tools to locate bodiesMost of the bodies were found under the broken bridge as the river did not have any flow and the water did not carry them away, Mr Kumar said.He said there could be only one or two bodies left to be found, based on data of missing people given by the civil administration.Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday\\xa0visited the hospital in Morbi city where the injured people are being treated. The facility got a quick-fix facelift overnight ahead of his visit.The narrow cable bridge collapsed due to a huge rush of people, sources in the Gujarat forensics laboratory have said. Some of the old cables that held the bridge were not changed during the seven-month renovation that started in March this year, sources have said.'"

However, the SOPs were not made applicable to suspension bridges where sightseers are allowed ticketed entry because the activity is not classified as \\'recreational\\'. Though separate rules exist for bridges, these are mostly commuter bridges. Had Morbi\\'s suspension bridge been put under the \\'recreational ride\\' category, regular safety checks and accountability could have further prevented the tragedy.

However, as suspension footbridges like the one in Morbi are not classified as \\'recreational\\', despite being ticketed, the rules for amusement rides don\\'t apply to bridges,\" said an official in the state roads and building department who did not wish to be named. In Ahmedabad alone, between 2012 and 2020, there have been seven major accidents at melas or temporary fairs. These include deaths caused due to electrocution, fall, and injuries. Read AlsoWhy govt has a lot to answer in Morbi tragedyAs the death toll in the bridge collapse mounted to 135, local authorities have been quick to blame the private contractor for the lapses that led to the tragedy. But there are several questions they still need to answerThe rules that were framed by the seven-member committee after the Kankaria disaster came into effect in February 2020 in Ahmedabad district. The SOPs were the first of their kind; they ensured safety checks and inspection rules for recreational rides. Later, in 2021, the state government, through a notification, asked all districts to set up similar technical committees to implement these rules.

We haven\\'t found anything so far to confirm if any of those worn-out cables were changed,\" said a police officer privy to the probe. \"We are now looking into thisThe seven-member committee set up for Ahmedabad district under the chairmanship of executive engineer of roads and building department included the R&B department\\'s deputy executive engineer, two teachers from LD Engineering College and Ahmedabad Polytechnic, and officials of the industrial health and safety department and municipal corporation\\'s engineering department. So far, the committee has inspected and issued safety certificates to 16 amusement rides in the city. The suspension bridges were excluded from the purview of these committees, said roads and buildings department sources. The state government could have set up a separate system to ensure safety inspections of such structures, they said. Read AlsoGujarat: Morbi tragedy exposes rot in civic systemThe Morbi tragedy has exposed the rot in civic institutions and their failure to ensure safe and reliable infrastructure. The contractor, Oreva group, was to approach the district collector for a structural safety certificate before beginning operations on October 26.Sources added that for the inspection of bridges, the operator is required to apply to the collector\\'s office and then the R&B department issues structural stability certificates after inspection. The government is yet to set up SOPs for these bridges, the sources added. '"
